``pixell`` is a library for loading, manipulating and analyzing maps stored in rectangular pixelization. It is mainly targeted for use with maps of the sky (e.g. CMB intensity and polarization maps, stacks of 21 cm intensity maps, binned galaxy positions or shear) in cylindrical projection, but its core functionality is more general. It extends numpy's ``ndarray`` to an ``ndmap`` class that associates a World Coordinate System (WCS) with a numpy array.  It includes tools for Fourier transforms  (through numpy or pyfft) and spherical harmonic transforms (through ducc0_) of such maps and tools for visualization (through the Python Image Library).

Dependencies
------------

* Python>=3.7
* gcc/gfortran or Intel compilers (clang might not work out of the box), if compiling from source
* ducc0_, healpy, Cython, astropy, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pyyaml, h5py, Pillow (Python Image Library)

On MacOS, and other systems with non-traditional environments, you should specify the following standard environment variables:

* ``CC``: C compiler (example: ``gcc``)
* ``CXX``: C++ compiler (example: ``g++``)
* ``FC``: Fortran compiler (example: ``gfortran``)

We recommend using ``gcc`` installed from Homebrew to access these compilers on
MacOS, and you should make sure to point e.g. `$CC` to the full path of your gcc installation,
as the `gcc` name usually points to the Apple `clang` install by default.

You will also need to specify the environment variable ``DUCC0_NUM_THREADS`` for
correct runtime behaviour on MacOS (e.g. running the test suite), specifying the
number of threads to run certain parallel operations with. This should typically
be set to the number of physical cores on your machine. If you recieve an error
saying ``Assertion failure no thread pool active``, it is likely that this
variable is either unset or set to a garbage value that cannot be interpreted by
the ``ducc0`` library.

Installing
----------

Make sure your ``pip`` tool is up-to-date. To install ``pixell``, run:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ pip install pixell --user
   $ test-pixell

This will install a pre-compiled binary suitable for your system (only Linux and Mac OS X with Python>=3.7 are supported). Note that you need ``~/.local/bin`` to be in your ``PATH`` for the latter ``test-pixell`` to work.

If you require more control over your installation, e.g. using Intel compilers, please see the section below on compiling from source.  The ``test-pixell`` command will run a suite of unit tests.

Compiling from source (advanced / development workflow)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For compilation instructions specific to NERSC/cori, see NERSC_.

For all other, below are general instructions.

First, download the source distribution or ``git clone`` this repository. You can work from ``master`` or checkout one of the released version tags (see the Releases section on Github). Then change into the cloned/source directory.


Run ``setup.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If not using Intel compilers (see below), build the package using 

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ python setup.py build_ext -i

You may now test the installation:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ py.test pixell/tests/
   
If the tests pass, you can install the package (optionally with ``-e`` if you would like to edit the files after installation)
   
.. code-block:: console

   $ python setup.py install --user

   
Intel compilers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intel compilers require you to modify the build step above as follows

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ python setup.py build_ext -i --fcompiler=intelem --compiler=intelem

On some systems, further specification might be required (make sure to get a fresh copy of the repository before trying out a new install method), e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

   $ LDSHARED="icc -shared" LD=icc LINKCC=icc CC=icc python setup.py build_ext -i --fcompiler=intelem --compiler=intelem

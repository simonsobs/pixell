``pixell`` is a library for loading, manipulating and analyzing maps stored in rectangular pixelization. It is mainly targeted for use with maps of the sky (e.g. CMB intensity and polarization maps, stacks of 21 cm intensity maps, binned galaxy positions or shear) in cylindrical projection, but its core functionality is more general. It extends numpy's ``ndarray`` to an ``ndmap`` class that associates a World Coordinate System (WCS) with a numpy array.  It includes tools for Fourier transforms  (through numpy or pyfft) and spherical harmonic transforms (through libsharp) of such maps and tools for visualization (through the Python Image Library).

Dependencies
------------

* Python>=2.7 or Python>=3.4
* gcc/gfortran or Intel compilers (clang might not work out of the box)
* libsharp (downloaded and installed)
* automake (for libsharp compilation)
* healpy, Cython, astropy, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pyyaml, h5py, Pillow (Python Image Library)

Installing
----------

To install, run:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ python setup.py install --user

To test the installation, you can run:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ python setup.py test
   

Existing ``libsharp`` installation (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libsharp is installed automatically by setup.py. If instead you want to use an existing ``libsharp`` installation, you can do so by symlinking the ``libsharp`` directory into a directory called ``_deps`` in the root directory, such that the file ``pixell/_deps/libsharp/libsharp/sharp.c`` exists.

   
Intel compilers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Intel compilers might require a two step installation as follows

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ python setup.py build_ext -i --fcompiler=intelem --compiler=intelem
   $ python setup.py install --user


Development workflow (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are a developer, run:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ python setup.py build_ext -i

and add the cloned directory to your Python path so that changes you make in any python file are immediately reflected. e.g., in your ``.bashrc`` file,

.. code-block:: bash
		
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/cloned/pixell/directory

If you also need non-Python code to be recompiled, run:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ python setup.py clean


before the above steps.

To test the installation under development mode, you can run:

.. code-block:: console
		
   $ py.test
   
   
This requires the pytest Python package to be installed.

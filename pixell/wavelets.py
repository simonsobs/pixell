# Note on units:
#  The current version uses "pix" normalization. With flat-sky
#  this is equivalent to physical normalization up to a constant:
#  the average pixel area. However, on the curved sky this isn't
#  the case, and it's better to just work with physical units.
#  By physical units, I mean units where the mean of the square
#  of a wavelet map is the power spectrum value for that map's
#  typical l.

# leaks power between wavelet scales due to their overlap. Because the wavelets
# overlap, there are more degrees of freedom in the wavelet coefficients than
# in the input map, meaning that the transform can't be invertible.

	"""This class implements a wavelet tansform. It provides thw forwards and

	and the wavelet coefficients are represented as multimaps.

	Example usage:

	 from pixell import enmap, uharm, wavelets, enplot
	 map  = make_some_enmap()
	 # Construct a UHT object, which handles both flat-sky and curved-sky
	 # transforms. By default it selects automatically based on the map geometry,

	 # Construct a wavelet transform using the default ButterTrim kernels.
	 # wt.nlevel will be the number of wavelet scales in use
	 wt   = wavelets.WaveletTransform(uht)
	 # Compute the wavelet coefficients for the map. These are multimaps,
	 # which are conceptually a list of enmaps that can be accessed with
	 # wmap.maps[i], but are actually stored as a single contiguous array,
	 # and can be operated on using mathematical operations just like a
	 # enmap, e.g. wmap *= 2 etc. pixell.multimap has various functions
	 # that make it easier to work with these, which can often be used
	 # to avoid needing to loop over .maps[].
	 #
	 # The wavelet coefficients have the same units as the alms, so for
	 # a homogeneous map, the variance of each wavelet map will match the
	 # power spectrum at that map's typical scale, which can be accessed
	 # using the .lmids member of the wavelet transform object.
	 wmap  = wt.map2wave(map)

		* basis: A basis-generating function, which provides the definition of the wavelet
		  filters. Defaults to ButterTrim(), which is fast to evaluate and decently local
		  both spatially and harmonically. The minimum and maximum multipole to use, as well
		  as the harmonic resolution, are all controlled by this.
		* ores: The resolution of the wavelet maps. If None, these are automatically
		  determined, and will be variable-resolution with the low-l maps having lower
		  resolution. If ores is a single number, then all the wavelet maps will have
		  this resolution in radians. This is inefficient, but may be useful for plotting
		  purposes. If ores is an array, then it must have length nlevel, and specifies
		  the resolution to use for each individual wavelet scale. This can be a bit
		  tricky to use since nlevel usually is calculated later. Therefore this variant
		  is probably best used with a fully initialized basis object (one where lmin and
		  lmax were passed in when the basis was constructed, after which basis.n gives
		  the number of levels).
		* norms: Used to override the wavelet normalization. Usually not used directly.

		Flat-sky transforms should be exact. Curved-sky transforms become slightly inaccurate

		I haven't tracked this down, but hopefully it isn't a big issue.

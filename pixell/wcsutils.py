# Geometry construction redesign
#
# The old approach was build around the reference point. The idea was that
# this point would always be a pixel center, no matter which coutout of
# the sky one was looking at. The problem with this approach is that it doesn't
# generalize to downgrading, and it clashes with finer detalies such as
# distinguishing between CC and Fejer1, which care about the pixel alignment
# at the poles, not the equator where the reference point usually is.
#
# The new approach will proceed in three steps:
# 1. Specify the projection (ctype, crval) without any pixel details
# 2. Turn it into a full-sky pixelization (crpix, cdelt). This could
#    be done by specifying ny,nx or the resolution. We could here
#    issue a warning or exception if the sky isn't evenly tiled.
#    This part would care about sub-specifiers like :cc or :fejer1
# 3. Crop this to cover the target area
#
# These can all be handled in separate functions. The output from step
# 1 would be a wcs with default crpix and cdelt values.
#
# Problems:
# 1. Currently pixelization can't handle all of these:
#    * Fix left side but allow right side to float
#    * Fix right side but allow left side to float
#    * Fix both sides, but allow total width to float
#    Right now the first two are supported, but not the last.
#    For example, for CEA we can't expect a reasonable resolution
#    to reach the poles with a senible pixel offset, but we want to
#    at least make things symmetric around the equator. There's a choice
#    between trying to get a pixel edge as close to the poles as possible
#    or trying to get a pixel center as close to the poles as possible.
#    These could be written as hh adjust and 00 adjust, but hard to fit
#    this in currently.
# 2. Some projections have extra parameters, like CEA with lambda and
#    ZEA where one might want to be locally conformal. The approach where
#    one first builds the fullsky geometry and only later worried about
#    restricting it to a part of the sky clashes with this. Can support it,
#    but is it a good idea to do it automatically?

#  shape: [2], optional
# In cases where shape is not specified, the implied

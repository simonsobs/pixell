"""bench: Simple timing of python code blocks.

Example usage:

	1. Manual printing

	from pixell import bench
	for i in range(nfile):
		with bench.mark("all"):
			with bench.mark("read"):
				a = np.loadtxt(afiles[i])
				b = np.loadtxt(bfiles[i])
			with bench.mark("sum"):
				a += b
			with bench.mark("write"):
				np.savetxt(ofiles[i], a)
		print("Processed case %d in %7.4f s. read %7.4f sum %7.4f write %7.4f" % (i, bench.t.all, bench.t.read, bench.t.sum, bench.t.write))
	print("Total %7.4f s. read %7.4f sum %7.4f write %7.4f" % (i, bench.t_tot.all, bench.t_tot.read, bench.t_tot.sum, bench.t_tot.write))

	2. Quick-and-dirty printing

	from pixell import bench
	for i in range(nfile):
		with bench.show("read"):
			a = np.loadtxt(afiles[i])
			b = np.loadtxt(bfiles[i])
		with bench.show("sum"):
			a += b
		with bench.show("write"):
			np.savetxt(ofiles[i], a)

	bench.show is equivalent to bench.mark, just with an extra print.
	This means that bench.show updates .ttot and .n just like bench.mark
	does.

The examples above collect statistics globally. You can create local
benchmark objects with bench.Bench(). Example:

	from pixell import bench
	mybench = bench.Bench()
	with mybench.mark("example"):
		do_something()

The overhead of bench.mark is around 3 Âµs.
